Databases are an essential component of most web applications; having a database allows your app to have a &ldquo;memory&rdquo; over time.

Laravel makes it convenient to connect to a variety of database types:

+ MySQL
+ SQLite
+ PostgreSQL
+ SQL Server

([Here's a great article on the differences between these database types](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems))

What these databases have in common: **SQL (Structured Query Language)**.

In the following notes, we're going to look how you'd go about using SQL to talk to a MySQL database from PHP. This is all done outside the context of Laravel to give you an overview of the underlying work Laravel will be helping you accomplish. Don't worry about executing any of the code in this note set&mdash; there are more concrete examples coming up.



## Hello SQL

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a language designed for interacting with **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**.

For an example, here's an SQL command to create a new table called `books`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    author VARCHAR(255),
    published INT(4),
    cover VARCHAR(255),
    purchase_link VARCHAR(255)
);
```

Here's an SQL command to add a new row in the `books` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO books SET
	title = 'The Great Gatsby',
	author = 'F. Scott Fitzgerald',
	published = 1925,
	cover = 'http://img2.imagesbn.com/p/9780743273565_p0_v4_s114x166.JPG',
	purchase_link = 'http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-great-gatsby-francis-scott-fitzgerald/1116668135?ean=9780743273565';
```	
		
Here's an SQL command that would fetch all the rows in the `books` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books
```

Finally, here's an SQL command that would fetch all the rows from the `books` table where the author name included the word &ldquo;Scott&rdquo;:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE author LIKE '%Scott%'
```
		
These commands are pretty human readable, so you should get the gist of what they're doing, but take a moment to skim over this [SQL Cheat Sheet](http://www.sql.su/) to see the variety of commands that SQL has.




## Executing SQL from PHP
		
The above statements can be run via command line using MySQL, or directly from your PHP scripts using [PHP's mysqli extension](http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.quickstart.statements.php).

Here's an example of a PHP script that connects to a database (`foobooks`) and then runs a SQL query against a table in this database (`SELECT * FROM books`):

```php
# Connect to the database
$mysqli = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "root", "foobooks");
if ($mysqli->connect_errno) {
 	echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: (" . $mysqli->connect_errno . ") " . $mysqli->connect_error;
}

# Run a query
$books = $mysqli->query("SELECT * FROM books");

# Loop through results
$books->data_seek(0);
while ($book = $books->fetch_assoc()) {
 	echo $book['title']." was written by ".$book['author']."<br>";
} 
```





## Enter Laravel...

Everything described thus far is roughly what you'd do if you were interacting with a database without the utilities Laravel provides. 

However, because database interaction is such an essential aspect of application development, Laravel gives us plenty of tools to make the job easier.

Here's just some of the examples of the benefits Laravel provides for database interaction:

+ Easily switch between databases.
+ Manage different databases depending on your environment.
+ Don't worry about SQL syntax and compatibility with different database types.
+ Automatically protects against [SQL Injection Attacks](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png).
+ Object mapping - the ability to easily connect the Objects of your application to rows in a table.
	
From this point forward we're going to look at database interaction from the perspective of Laravel which is going to abstract a lot of the SQL work we did above. Despite this, it's still useful to have a foundational SQL understanding so you better understand what Laravel is doing beneath the surface.
