## Posts
Blog entries

* Individual blog-like entries on your WordPress site. 
* By default, all posts are listed on your site's homepage, in reverse chronological order. 
* Posts are typically something you'll create regularly.




## Pages
Pages on your site

* Pages on your site. Ex: *About* page, *Portfolio* page, *Contact* page. 
* Unlike posts which you might be creating on a regular basis, pages are mostyle static.




## Other differences 
* Posts are included in the RSS feed WordPress generates for your site.
* Pages can be nested. Example: Within a page called *Portfolio*, you may nest a page for *Illustration*, *Photography*, *Video*, etc.
* You can have a page that displays posts. For example, you might want to create a page called *Top 5* that shows your top 5 blog posts of all time.




## To-Do

* Add a new post.
* Edit the permalinks.
* Look at *Publish Options*, *Post Types* and *Featured Image* options.
