## Finding themes

* In the Appearance > Themes section of wp-admin you can see all your installed themes and designate your active theme.
* Find new themes under Appearance > Add New.
* Filter themes by color, column, width, and features.
* To learn more about a theme, visit its page in the WordPress Themes Directory (<http://wordpress.org/themes>).




## Installing themes

Chosen theme: <http://wordpress.org/themes/mog>

* There are two ways to install themes.
* With *Theme Installer*, just click the *Install* button. So easy!
* Otherwise, to manually install a theme, download it to your computer, then upload it (via FTP) directly into `/wordpress/wp-content/themes`.
* You can activate a different theme by clicking the *Activate* link next to any theme.




## Types of themes

### Free 
* Budget friendly, limited selection.
* Stick to the WordPress themes directory because they're vouced for and less likely to have malware.

### Premium 
* Cost money, typically between $10 and $100.
* Often come with better customization options and online support.
* Some good marketplaces:
	* [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/themes/wordpress)
	* [The Best Designs](http://www.thebestdesigns.com/design/themes/)
	
### Custom




## What to look for 
* Make sure it matches your goal:
	* Ex: Selling TShirts? Look for a e-commerce styled theme.
	* Ex: Selling guided tours? Look for a mobile friendly theme.
* Customization
	* Look at the theme specs&mdash; what do they let you control?
* Structure
	* Valid, up-to-date HTML/CSS.
	* Search Engine Optimized.
* Good documentation and support.
* Lots of downloads and positive reviews is a good sign.
* Up to date; avoid themes like this: <http://wordpress.org/themes/abel-one>
