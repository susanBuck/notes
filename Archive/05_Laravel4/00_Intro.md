A framework is a package of code.

Included in this package is a bunch of **libraries** which power the essentials of application development, for example:

* Routing
* Environment management
* Database interaction
* User authentication
* etc.

With all this taken care of, it frees you up to start building the functionality of *your* application. 

In addition to this, a framework provides a **skeleton** in which to build your application.

Most PHP frameworks follow the **MVC Pattern**:

**Benefits of working with a framework:**

* Don't reinvent the wheel.
* Work with tried and tested code.
* Write code that is more universally understood.

## Starting assumptions

* You have a local server running using MAMP.
* You have a working understanding of using command line.
* Windows users: All CL instructions assume you're working from [Cmder](http://bliker.github.io/cmder/).
* You have a working understanding of Git.
* When you run `git` in the CL, the command is found (i.e. Git for CL is installed).
* When you run `php` in the CL, the command is found.

If you have any issues with the above, revisit the note *Version Control* and/or *SysAdmin* notes.
