## Task

Create a website for Mariposa Bakery in Cambridge

Background: <http://www.yelp.com/biz/mariposa-bakery-cambridge>

Planning: Create a directory called `mariposa/` somewhere on your local computer.
Inside of it, create the .html files and subdirectories you'll need to organize your site based on the criteria below.

## Assets (images, menu, etc)

* <http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/html-exercise-butteryfly-logo.jpg>
* <http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/html-exercise-coffee-and-snack.jpg>
* <http://making-the-internet.s3.amazonaws.com/html-exercise-menu.pdf>

## Requirements

* All pages should have the logo ('html-exercise-butteryfly-logo.jpg')
* All pages should have a navigational menu with links to all the other pages (bonus: use a dash of [PHP includes](http://www.sophox.com/wordpress/?p=1158) to use one menu across all the pages)

Include the following pages:

* A landing page 
* Short blurb about the bakery
* Address
* Hours
	
A contact page:

* Address
* Phone Number
* Email ([ref: mailto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web-based_protocol_handlers))

A menu page:

* Includes the image `html-exercise-coffee-and-snack.jpg` at the top
* Convert some of `html-exercise-menu.pdf` into a [HTML table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) (just enough for proof of concept)
