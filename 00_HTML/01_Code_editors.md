## What is a code editor?
A code editor is a super-powered text editor. While you can write code in programs such as Notepad or TextEdit, code editors come packed with bonus features these regular text editors don’t have.

## Options
Suggested: Mac / PC: [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com/)

Window users, on the Sublime download page you'll see two options: regular (34-bit) and 64-bit. If you're not sure which version you have you can follow [the instructions here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit).

Other options:

* Chromebook: [Caret](http://web.appstorm.net/reviews/web-dev/caret-its-like-sublime-text-for-chromebooks/)
* Mac: [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/support/textwrangler/updates.html) 
* PC: [NotePad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

## WYSWIGs
Some code editors, such as Dreamweaver come built in with WYSWIG (What You See Is What You Get) editors. It’s tempting to use WYSWIGs when you’re first learning, but in the long run it's better to have full control of the code you’re writing.

## Features

### Line numbers

* Navigate your code more easily
* Helps for collaboration
* Helps for browser error reporting

### Syntax highlighting

* Color-code different parts of your code
* Helps read the code by distinguishing elements from variables from copy, etc.
* &ldquo;Off&rdquo; colors can help draw your attention to syntax errors


### Customizing your colors

	Mac: Sublime Text 2: Preferences: Color Schemes
	
	PC: Preferences: Color Schemes

* Pick colors / a scheme that is clearest to you

### Text Wrapping

	Mac/PC: View: ✓ Word Wrap

* Lines of code can get very long, but you don't want the editor to break those lines
* When working on paragraphs / copy, though, you'll want the lines to break
